                    Multithreaded Compression Algorithm 2022(C)
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            Developed and implemented a multithreaded compression algorithm using run-length encoding to compress large input variable datafiles in parallel.

                    Developed Simple Unix Shell 2022(C)
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            Coded a functional Unix shell in C performing functions such as taking in user input either from stdin or from a file, changing or using paths to perform commands like ls. Change directories, run commands in parallel and most other basic functions a shell would provide.

                    Machine Learning Star Type Classification Data Analysis 2021(Python)
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            A comprehensive data exploration using machine learning with Python in Jupyter notebook to investigate a dataset on star type classification for correlation and connection between the datapoints. Using sklearn for most of the training then applying linear regression and then a few classifiers.
